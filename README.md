# Recipe-App-Using-Mealdb-Web-API

Los Pollos Hermanos is the website which allows us to get the recipe of any meal by category or area.
This is my first project as a JS beginner.I created this project to learn some advance concepts of javascript like fetch, async, await etc.
This web app still has some issues and also some fetures hasn't added yet.
If you like this project Do explore into it and Let me know if there is any mistakes or any optimal solutions you have. So that I can improve myself.
